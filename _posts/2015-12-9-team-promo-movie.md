In a [recent blog article](https://capgemini.github.io/blog/capgemini-hiring-fatjil/), 
Tom spoke about the "Find a Tech Job In London" meetup that was hosted by
Capgemini. If you missed the meetup or if you're still looking for an exciting
opportunity, why not consider joining Capgemini? Join our Software Engineering
team and discover how fun it can be to be a part of a team that works on
challenging projects.

Some of our team members (including yours truly) were asked to pick up our
actor role and got in front of the camera to describe life as a software
engineer at Capgemini. You will not only get informed about what we are doing on
a day-to-day basis but you will also discover some very interesting facts about
your (possible) future colleagues!
