Enjoy a free ticket to one of the most sought after developer’s conference of the year, Devoxx UK 2017, courtesy of Capgemini Engineering.

Following a hugely successful 2016 which saw us as [Gold level sponsors of Devoxx UK](https://capgemini.github.io/agile/were-heading-to-devoxx/) and delivered two brilliant sessions on [Harnessing Domain Driven Design for Distributed Systems](https://youtu.be/j5tFNT55kmM) and [NFR Testing and Tuning - A Scientific Approach](https://youtu.be/SgM-ZRs-CyY), we’ve decided to do it again. But this time ***we’re platinum baby!*** 

Capgemini is set to return to Devoxx UK for a very special conference experience. [@Gayathri](https://twitter.com/gaythu_rajan) will be speaking again, this time discussing [Distributing Memory in Distributed Systems](http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/FSQ-8848/Distributing_Memory_in_Distributed_Systems), and exploring the potential pitfalls and solutions to distributing memory across distributed systems.

## Where?

Taking place at The Business Design Centre on the 11th and 12th of May 2017, your only way (apart from buying a late bird ticket) into the ultimate developer’s conference is to win a ticket!

With a ticket you will be able to wonder into sessions such as [Microservices for the Masses with Spring Boot, JHipster, and JWT](http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/RUN-7398/Microservices_for_the_Masses_with_Spring_Boot,_JHipster,_and_JWT), [The Anatomy of Java Vulnerabilities](http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/QFA-7776/The_Anatomy_of_Java_Vulnerabilities), [The reactive landscape](http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/OMW-8636/The_reactive_landscape), and [The DevOps Superpattern](http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/IBN-5679/The_DevOps_Superpattern). It’s an immersive, not to be missed, multi-disciplinary experience inspired by developers for developers.

## Get me in Now:

Our major theme this year is role models. So we would like to know who your role model is and why. Here is an example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy #IWD2017. Every woman who breaks through the stereo type and proves #yeswecan is #MyRoleModel. My mum, dad, hubs and my boss #heforshe.</p>&mdash; Gayathri (@gaythu_rajan) <a href="https://twitter.com/gaythu_rajan/status/839400328088911875">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
